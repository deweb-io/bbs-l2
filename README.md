Run a local optimism node (https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism-tutorial/tree/main/hardhat). Stop just befor the 'Migrate a Dapp to Optimistic Ethereum' section.

the last command you wrote was:
docker-compose -f docker-compose-nobuild.yml up -t 3600
and your local node is up.

[This last command can be interchanged with to run a local node
  docker-compose up
use
  docker-compose down
to end]
